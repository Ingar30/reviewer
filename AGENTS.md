# AGENTS.md

## Project purpose
This repository builds and runs a reproducible multi-agent reviewer for academic economics papers.

The normal workflow is:
1. Put source PDFs in `inputs/`.
2. Preprocess each paper into structured artifacts under `work/<paper_id>/parsed/`.
3. Render run-specific prompts under `work/<paper_id>/prompts/`.
4. Run parser-quality preflight before substantive review.
5. Route substantive reviewers around parser-quality warnings using deterministic artifacts.
6. Use dynamic reviewer selection by default to choose optional reviewers while mandatory reviewers always run.
7. Store the selector decision under `work/<paper_id>/selection/` and use the selected reviewer roster for downstream stages.
8. Rerender prompts for the selected reviewer roster with parser-quality guidance.
9. Run the selected reviewer agents on the parsed artifacts.
10. Store and validate reviewer JSON outputs under `work/<paper_id>/reviews/`.
11. Normalize and deduplicate reviewer outputs into an editor bundle.
12. Build editor input from the normalized bundle and original reviewer JSON files.
13. Run the editor to write the final markdown report under `outputs/<paper_id>/report.md`.
14. Smoke-check the final report.

## Canonical file locations
- Source PDFs: `inputs/`
- Parsed artifacts: `work/<paper_id>/parsed/`
- Reviewer outputs: `work/<paper_id>/reviews/`
- Reviewer selection: `work/<paper_id>/selection/`
- Final reports: `outputs/<paper_id>/`

## Path conventions
- If the user refers to a bare source PDF filename, first resolve it under `inputs/`.
- Prefer project-relative paths over absolute paths when possible.
- Do not assume a file is outside the repo unless the user explicitly says so.

## Workflow rules
- Never run reviewer agents directly on a raw PDF if parsed artifacts do not exist.
- Preprocessing comes before review.
- Reviewer agents are configured through `config/reviewers.json`.
- Dynamic reviewer selection is the default for fresh wrapper runs; static mode is available when all enabled reviewers should run.
- Substantive reviewers must read the parser-quality output and route around unsafe deterministic artifacts. If no trustworthy deterministic fallback exists, use `cannot_verify`; never generate or infer repaired text, signs, cells, values, or formulas.
- Internal reviewer agents return structured JSON only.
- Only the editor writes the final markdown report.
- If preprocessing artifacts are missing or clearly poor, fail clearly instead of guessing.
- Editor-only refresh is allowed when parsed artifacts, all selected reviewer JSON files, and the selected reviewer config already exist. Revalidate the reviews, rebuild the normalized bundle and editor input, rerun only the editor, and then smoke-check the final report.

## Preprocessing rules
- Preserve original page numbering.
- Normalize whitespace carefully.
- Never silently remove minus signs, decimal points, percent symbols, parentheses, or appendix labels.
- Save page-level outputs and inventories so downstream reviewers can cite locations precisely.
- Use OCR only when text extraction clearly fails or the PDF is scanned/image-only.

## Reviewer rules
- Literature and reference verification require web search when enabled.
- Never guess missing evidence; use `cannot_verify` or equivalent failure labels.
- Preserve exact source locations whenever possible.
- Keep reviewer outputs modular so failed reviewers can be rerun independently.
- Final reports should keep canonical/source finding identifiers in the traceability appendix rather than repeated body footers.

## Working style
- Prefer deterministic scripts for file handling, preprocessing, validation, and report assembly.
- Use Codex for judgment-heavy auditing and synthesis tasks.
- Keep the workflow reproducible, inspectable, and easy to rerun.
